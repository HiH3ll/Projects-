  <h2><b> THE SCOPE</b></h2>
 <p>Over a 6-week period for an in class project we brainstormed an idea related to health and we wanted to focus on a topic that we all   cared about. Our app  focuses on the  topic of health and we collaboratively decided on focusing on women's menstrual cycle which, is a niche topic  that is equally as important and often not emphasized on enough. There is a like of social sigma that are associated with a woman's period and is an uncomfortable and unknown topic for young women and teenagers. We introduced an app that aims to help desensitize period stigmas.</p>
  <h2>The Interview & Observation Process</h2> 
 <p>Early on into our research we started to do some field observations visiting different drug stores and store's period aisle to see what people were doing. Since this is a private  topic and matter, we would have some problems gathering pertinent insights we needed so the survey was another approach. We thought that this would create a safe space for more women to willingly share their experiences.  The target group of our app is young girls to young women. We  made an anonymous survey and asked among our friend circle to fill out the responses.  We received a total of 42 responses in total.</p>
 <p>Here is the list of questions that we asked in our survey:</p> 
 <ol>
  <li>What your name, age, occupation?</li>
  <li>When was the last time you got your period?</li>
  <li>Tell me about your experience when first getting your period.</li>
  <li>Walk me through your typical week on your period.</li>
  <li>What feminine product do you prefer to use? Why?</li>
  <li>Do you track your period?</li>
  <li>Talk about a notable experience on your period.</li>
  <li>Show them storyboards and have them rate  1- 5 to how much it relates to them. </li>
 </ol>
 <p>Gathering information from our responses, we analyzed the responses and created an affinity diagram to categorize common things we found. In addition, we did additional online research about common problems women face with their menstrual cycle and looked at competitors  specifically in the digital application space.
  
  In our online research that we gathered, we found that the topic of period was a trending topic on social media and many young girls feel that it is a topic that they are not comfortable with speaking up about. Periods can also cause a big hindrance to women's daily routines due to pain and other symptoms. Our online competitive analysis, we saw that there were already many existing period trackers available on the market and the most popular ones we found were Clue, Eve, Shvrk, etc. 
  
  We collected a lot of data from the feedback received from the survey and wanted to listen to  what the common trends were that our respondents were writing about. We divided into several categories which ranged from symptoms, remedies, conveniences/fears , misconceptions, precautions, empowerment, and feminine products. 

Grouping this into categories helped us decide how we should approach the problems and find solutions to it.  
Recurring themes we found were that there was lack of knowledge, having anxiety over flows and dealing with the bad symptoms. 

<h2><b>Personas and Storyboards</b></h2>
<p>We worked on who our target audience was going to be on for this online application and we thought of two  potential age range. The first one was a young girl primarily in her early puberty that is just getting to learn about her period and has little knowledge about the topic of period and the other target was going to a person in her early twenties that is a working professional. </p>
